###Adding Materialize to Angular

Assuming that you already have a working knowledge of javascript and Angular 1 -- this document will walk you through setting up a basic angular app with the angular-materialize directive based on Materialize CSS.

The styling in this example is very light, but it is setup to add any functional angular-materialize components.

Materialize and angular-materialize are very similar, but not exactly the same -- there are things that work in materialize and not in angular-materialize. The most recent documentation on what works or doesn't is available in the [angular-materialize directive docs](http://krescruz.github.io/angular-materialize/#!).

This example has a simple app structure of only three files:
* index.html
* app.js
* style.css

Take a look at the files individually or load the app to view its functionality.

To view this demo project on your computer:
* clone this repo (fork if you like)
* cd into the folder
* run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
* go to `http://localhost:8000/#/` in your browser
